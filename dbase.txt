CREATE SQL DATABASE WITH HEROKU POSTGRES

ISSUES TO ADDRESS:

1. PMO COUNTER AND AUTO-UPDATING IT DAILY (done)
  -PMO in database are date objects  [COUNTER]
  -Upon registering -> P/M/O in database initialized e.g. (let p = new Date().getTime())
  -  -Upon reset, create new date object

  -Front end will do the calculation and display of the days
  -Math.floor((Date.now() - p)/ 8E)



2. BCRYPT AND HASHING (done: using SYNC for now, might have to change to async afterwards lookintoit... NO NEED for login table)
  -DO WE NEED TO CREATE A SEPARATE LOGIN TABLE LIKE SMART-BINO OR IS THE USERS TABLE SUFFICIENT?/

3. DATE OBJECTS WITHIN DATABASE
  -CURRENTLY IN UTC(?) FORMAT?


4. AVG DAYS PER FAP MATH (CURRENTLY MESSY)
